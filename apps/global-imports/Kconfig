    help
        This app demonstrates including components and interfaces from some
        global include directory. The directories 'global/components' and
        'global/interfaces' are two such directories. They can be placed
        anywhere in the filesystem and the app will still compile. To have
        the compiler know where the include directories are, set the make option
        "CAMKES_IMPORT_PATH" in the "CAmkES Options" section of menuconfig
        to "/path/to/global/components /path/to/global/interfaces".
