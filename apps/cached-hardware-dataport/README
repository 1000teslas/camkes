This is a regression test for the cached hardware dataports feature of CAmkES.
It enables caching for a hardware dataport containing a uart device, and does
a test write to the device. It also tests error-handling, by flushing an
invalid range of addresses from the cached dataport.

THIS IS UNSAFE! It only exists to test that the cached hardware dataports
feature compiles and runs. The fact that there is no unusual behaviour when
using cached memory-mapped registers on the KZM simulator in qemu (the
platform for this app when running regression tests) is luck. Never enable
caching for a dataport backed by memory-mapped registers.
