Enhanced Periodic Interrupt Timer driver for KZM/SabreLite.

This application demonstrates the use of CAmkES interrupt connector to receive hardware
interrupts. Change the hardware memory address and interrupt number in file "epit.camkes"
if you have a different hardware setup. The timer rate may vary depending on the input
clock frequency of the hardware.
